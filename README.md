# DevOps Git Practice Project – Task 4 🚀

## 📌 Objective

This project is part of **Task 4: Build a Version-Controlled DevOps Project with Git**.
The goal is to practice Git branching, pull requests (PRs), merging, tagging, and documentation in a real-world workflow.

---

## 🏗️ Step-by-Step Practice Plan

### 🔹 1. Create a Local Project

```bash
mkdir devops-task4
cd devops-task4
echo "# DevOps Git Practice Project" > README.md
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
```

### 🔹 2. Create a Remote GitHub Repo

1. Go to GitHub → **New repository** → name it `devops-task4`.
2. Copy the repo HTTPS link and run:

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/devops-task4.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

### 🔹 3. Create Branches

```bash
git checkout -b dev
git push -u origin dev

git checkout -b feature-hello
```

### 🔹 4. Work on Feature Branch

Example script and workflow:

```bash
echo "print('Hello DevOps')" > hello.py
git add hello.py
git commit -m "Added hello.py script"
git push -u origin feature-hello
```

* Then open a PR on GitHub: **feature-hello → dev** and merge it once reviewed.

### 🔹 5. Merge Dev into Main

* Open a PR from **dev → main** on GitHub and merge after checks.

### 🔹 6. Add .gitignore

```bash
echo "*.log" > .gitignore
git add .gitignore
git commit -m "Add .gitignore to exclude log files"
git push origin dev
```

> Tip: If you get a push rejection, run `git pull origin dev --rebase` first, resolve conflicts if any, then push.

### 🔹 7. Tag a Version

```bash
git tag v1.0
git push origin v1.0
```

### 🔹 8. Document the Project

Create a `TASK4_NOTES.md` file to keep your notes and learning summary.

```markdown
# Task 4 - Git Practice

## Steps I followed
1. Initialized repo
2. Created branches (main, dev, feature)
3. Added hello.py script
4. Used Pull Requests to merge
5. Added .gitignore
6. Created tags

## What I Learned
- Git branching
- Pull requests
- Conflict resolution
- Git tags and .gitignore
```

Commit and push `TASK4_NOTES.md` to the repo. ✅

---

## 📂 Final Repository Structure

```
devops-task4/
│── README.md
│── TASK4_NOTES.md
│── hello.py
│── .gitignore
```

* **Branches:** `main`, `dev`, `feature-*`
* **Pull Requests:** history of merges and code reviews
* **Commits:** meaningful commit messages
* **Tags:** version tags like `v1.0`

---

## 🎯 What You’ll Learn

* Initializing and managing a Git project
* Creating and switching between branches
* Writing commits and pushing to remote
* Pull Request (PR) workflow for collaboration
* Using `.gitignore` effectively
* Tagging versions for release management

---

If you want, I can also generate the other files (`TASK4_NOTES.md`, `hello.py`, `.gitignore`) and provide a ZIP of the project. Want me to add those now?
