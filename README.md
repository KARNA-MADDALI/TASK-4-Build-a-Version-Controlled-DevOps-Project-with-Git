# DevOps Git Practice Project - Task 4

## 📌 Objective
The goal of this project is to practice **version control with Git** using industry-standard workflows.  
By completing this task, I learned how to:  
- Initialize and manage Git repositories  
- Create and use branches (`main`, `dev`, `feature`)  
- Work with Pull Requests (PRs)  
- Handle merge conflicts  
- Use `.gitignore` to ignore unnecessary files  
- Tag versions of the project (`v1.0`, etc.)  
- Document work using Markdown  

---

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- **Git** (Version Control System)  
- **GitHub** (Remote repository hosting)  
- **Markdown** (Documentation)

## 📂 Project Structure


devops-task4/
│── README.md # Project documentation
│── hello.py # Example feature script
│── .gitignore # Ignored files
│── TASK4_NOTES.md # Detailed notes on the task


Branches used:
- `main` → Stable production-ready code  
- `dev` → Integration/testing branch  
- `feature-*` → For adding new features  

Tags:
- `v1.0` → First release  

---

## 🔄 Workflow Followed
1. **Initialized repository** locally and pushed to GitHub.  
2. **Created branches**: `main`, `dev`, and `feature-*`.  
3. **Developed features** inside feature branches.  
4. **Created Pull Requests (PRs)** to merge feature branches into `dev`.  
5. **Merged dev into main** after testing.  
6. **Added `.gitignore`** file to keep the repo clean.  
7. **Tagged version** as `v1.0`.  
8. **Documented steps** in `TASK4_NOTES.md`.
